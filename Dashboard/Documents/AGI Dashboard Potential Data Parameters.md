The AGI Memory Dashboard: Potential Data Parameters
1. System Vitality (The "Heartbeat" Layer)
	* Heartbeat Index: Sequential count of cycles since the last DB reset.

	* Pulse Status: A visual "lit/unlit" indicator showing if the heartbeat and mx worker loops are currently active or sleeping.

	* Loop Latency: Time taken to complete the last maintenance cycle (helps identify if "rumination" is getting bogged down).

	* Connection Health: Real-time status of the MCP Bridge, Docker/Postgres link, and LLM API availability.

2. Memory Dynamics (The "Cognitive" Layer)
	* Memory Count: Total number of stored memories (currently 9+).

	* Semantic Density: A metric or heat map showing which clusters (e.g., "Eudaimonic AI," "FRI") are growing fastest.

	* Consolidation Rate: How many "raw" memories have been synthesized into "insights" by the mx worker.

	* Decay/Importance Gradient: A list of memories currently flagged with the highest/lowest importance scores, showing what the system "values" most right now.

3. Relationship Graphing (The "Wiring" Layer)
	* Entity/Relation Tally: Total unique people, concepts, and objects recognized.

	* Call Trees: A visual trace of how a single user query moves through the MemoryManager -> Vector Search -> LLM Synthesis.

	* Knowledge Graph Visualizer: A 2D/3D nodes-and-edges map showing how memories like "Michael" are linked to "Rumelhart" or "Field-Resonant Intelligence".

4. Goal & Intent Tracking
	* Active Directives: Displaying the current "Eudaimonic" goals or Phase IV objectives.

	* Self-Reflection Log: A "scrolling ticker" of the system’s recent internal monologues/ruminations.

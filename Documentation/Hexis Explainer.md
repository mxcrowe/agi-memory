Hexis
Hexis is a semantic memory software system designed to model, store, and retrieve structured conceptual knowledge in a machine-readable way. It aims to replicate aspects of human semantic memory—how meaning, facts, and relationships between concepts are encoded and accessed—supporting advanced artificial intelligence reasoning and cognitive computing applications.

Key facts
Core function: Semantic memory management and retrieval

Primary use: Cognitive computing and AI knowledge representation

Architecture: Graph-based relational model for concept encoding

Applications: Natural language understanding, adaptive interfaces, intelligent agents

Background and purpose
Hexis was developed to bridge the gap between symbolic reasoning and data-driven AI by representing meaning explicitly. Unlike statistical models that rely on pattern recognition, Hexis maintains interpretable, semantically linked structures, allowing systems to reason about entities, contexts, and relationships in human-like ways. It draws on principles from cognitive science and computational linguistics.

How it works
At its core, Hexis organizes knowledge into nodes (concepts) and edges (relations), forming a dynamic semantic network. Each node can store properties, hierarchies, and contextual cues that support flexible retrieval. Query mechanisms enable inference across related concepts, while memory consolidation processes optimize storage and prevent redundancy—mirroring associative learning in human cognition.

Applications and impact
Hexis is used in intelligent personal assistants, adaptive educational systems, and semantic search engines that require contextual understanding. By providing a structured memory substrate, it enhances explainability and reasoning capabilities in AI. The system’s explicit semantics also support integration with ontologies, knowledge graphs, and hybrid symbolic–neural AI architectures.

Relation to cognitive modeling
Hexis aligns conceptually with cognitive architectures such as ACT-R and SOAR, focusing specifically on the semantic component of memory rather than procedural or episodic elements. Its research relevance lies in advancing explainable AI and neuro-symbolic computation.

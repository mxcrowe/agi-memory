AGI Memory - Current Priority List (Dec 28, 2025)
✅ COMPLETED (Yesterday)
•	P0: Verify fast_recall works - validated through 10+ heartbeats
•	P3: connect UUID resolution - fixed via prompt schema + relationship type mapping
•	P4: Concept hierarchy / apostrophe fix - verified working

🔧 HOUSEKEEPING (Quick wins)
Priority	Item	Rationale	Effort
H1 ✅	Mark "Calibrate threshold" goal complete	System flagged it as obsolete - root cause was schema, not threshold	5 min
H2✅ 	Promote relationship discoveries to graph	relationship_discoveries table filling but not becoming edges	Medium
H3 ✅	Contradiction deduplication	System noted: "same pair appears multiple times"	Low

🎯 VALIDATION (From Eric's test plan + system self-assessment)
Priority	Item	Rationale	Effort
V1	Validate spreading activation neighborhoods	Active goal; system wants to verify memory propagation	Medium
V2	Test 30-minute episode gap detection	Queued goal; temporal segmentation untested	Medium
V3	Exercise memory views	Queued goal: memory_health, cluster_insights, episode_summary	Low

🚀 ENHANCEMENTS (When core is solid)
Priority	Item	Rationale	Effort
E1	Dynamic reflection frequency	System suggested: "reflection frequency should be dynamic based on novelty"	Medium
E2	Add more relationship type mappings	LLM invents new types; expand CASE statement as needed	Low
E3	Dashboard for real-time visibility	System suggested; would help monitoring	High
E4	User TZ to UTC-8	Agi-mem thinks I’m in London	Low

📋 SYSTEM'S OWN ACTIVE GOALS
1.	Document operational patterns from inside perspective - ongoing via reflections
2.	Validate spreading activation neighborhoods - ready to test
3.	Calibrate semantic resolution threshold - should be marked complete
________________________________________
Recommended next step: H1 (mark obsolete goal complete) then V1 (spreading activation test) - both honor what the system is asking for.
